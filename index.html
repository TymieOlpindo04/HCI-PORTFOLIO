            <h2> T Y M I E </h2>
            <p> Hi!! I am Tymie Olpindo, turning 21 this coming August. I took a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology because I don't have any courses that I actually like. There is nothingÂ special about me because I am not special. I have a motto in life: "Live your life to the fullest because life is short." That's all.</p>

                <p>Drinking coffee is one of my hobbies these days because coffee comforts me whenever I'm sad. Even if I am happy or just bored, I just drink coffee. Though coffee makes me palpitate, I still love it. Watching tiktok is one of my hobbies these days too. While drinking coffee, I just watch tiktok. Whenever I don't have anything to do, I just watch tiktok videos.</p>

                    I am a first-year college student. I am studying at Global Reciprocal College, taking a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I took this course because it was cool. I actually don't have any courses that I like, and my brother suggested this course because he also took information technology in GRC. So yah, that's all./p>
